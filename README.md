# Shortest Path in Grid with Obstacles

For reference: [Shortest Path in Grid With Obstacles](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/#:~:text=Shortest%20Path%20in%20a%20Grid%20with%20Obstacles%20Elimination%20%2D%20LeetCode&text=You%20are%20given%20an%20m%20x%20n,empty%20cell%20in%20one%20step.)

Approach used to solve is by utilizing BFS

Time complexity is O(N * M) where N is number of rows, M is number of columns.
